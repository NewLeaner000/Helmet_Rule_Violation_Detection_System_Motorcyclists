# Helmet_Rule_Violation_Detection_System_Motorcyclists.
The Helmet Rule Violation Detection System for Motorcyclists is designed to automatically detect whether motorcyclists are wearing helmets while riding. It uses video footage to identify and analyze motorcyclists, flagging any violations and ensuring compliance with helmet laws.

# The Framework:
TensorFlow, Jupyter, Kaggle, Python

# The model:
I use YOLOv8(m) train on Kaggle with GPU P100

# Dataset:
* https://universe.roboflow.com/study-eivvg/helmet-detection-and-license-plate-recognition-zfenu-ctzln
* Class: ['helmet', 'licenseplate', 'motorcyclist', 'nohelmet']

# Here comparison all model YOLO I make with 10 epoch
